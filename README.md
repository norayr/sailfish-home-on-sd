# sailfish-home-on-sd

initially taken from [here](https://together.jolla.com/question/108669/11928-mounting-sd-card-as-home-partition-and-android-storage/) and [here](https://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=92449&page=11)

small update to the script checks if there is an sd card, and if there is no, then device mounts the default home from the internal memory.
